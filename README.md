# Algo

## Part I

  * Basic data structures: list, double-linked list, stack, queue, deck, hash-table
  * O-notation: solving recurrents (for estimating asymptotics of algo)
  * Number Theory: sieve Eratosthenes, algo Euclid, RSA, check prime, factorization, binary exponention, inverse element in ring, code Gray, long arithmetics, discrete log, CTR, Gorner scheme, factorial modulus, primitive root, discrete root calculation
  * Algebra: Karatsuba polynom multiply, Furie transform, FFT, IFFT, Gauss solve, Strassen multiply, matrix inverse methods (no code), list of decompositions
  * Sorting: quick, heap, merge, bucket (+digital), Binary search  

## More:

  * BitHacks: submasks $3^n$
